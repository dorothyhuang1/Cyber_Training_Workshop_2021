5 folders contains

a. NEXMD_tutorail folder contains following 10 folders-

1. SCF__Ethyl has the single point calculation of ethylene in ground state
2. GeometryOptimization_2_ethy has the geometry optimization calculation of ethylene in single state
3. ExcitedStateEnergies_3_ethy has the single point calculation of ehylene in excited state
4. ExcitedStateGeometryOptimization_4_ethyl has the geometry optimization calculation ethylene in excited state
5. Newtonian_5_ethy has the molecular dynamics calculation in the ground state
6. Langevin_6_ethy has the calculation with langevin friction
7. ExcitedStateDynamics_7_ethy has the excited state dynamics calculation.
8. Solvent_8_ethy has the solvated calculations.
9. TrivialCrossing_9_ethy has the dynamics at trivial crossing point.
10. TrivialCrossing_10_ethy also contains the calculations regarding trivial crossing.

All these 10 folders contain output_files.zip which has the all output files along with .xyz and input file.

b. Python_tutorail_RK4 has the taylor series code and the RK4 code that was asked to do for 1st day homework

c. report.pdf is the project report file contains all the summary of the workshop.

d. qmflow.zip file contains two folders-

1. singlepoint_1 has the single point calcuations of ethylene molecule.
2. singlepoint_iron has the single point calculation of Ferric oxalate (But it has not worked out, I think due to basis set or basis function error)
